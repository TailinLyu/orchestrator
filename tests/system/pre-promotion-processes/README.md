# Test PrePromotionProcesses hook execution during master failover

This test verifies that the `PrePromotionProcesses` hook is executed at the appropriate time during a master failover operation.

The test flow:
1. Verify the initial topology (master and replicas)
2. Configure PrePromotionProcesses to output diagnostic information
3. Force a master failover
4. Check logs to confirm the PrePromotionProcesses hook was executed after recovery resolution but before standard post-promotion actions

This test validates that custom processes can be executed at the critical point between recovery resolution and the execution of post-promotion MySQL changes, allowing for potential operational interventions.
